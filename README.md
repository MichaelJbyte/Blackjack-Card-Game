### Python project to make Blackjack. | **PROGRAM CODE: [BLACKJACK](~~~~)**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my learning of Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP). I would like to experience the failures that come along with manually using OOP and learn about any errors encountered. To accomplish this, I will be creating a blackjack program, which should play the game, handle funds, and stop when desired. No tutorials will be used and assitance from Google will be permitted. Any methods or functions I learn during this project will be properly studied as opposed to being copied. Any new topics, the process of the code, and extra notes will be listed below. My aim for this project is to primarily demonstrate I understand OOP, logic flow, loops for validation, and anything else that may assist in my program.


## New Topics

Any syntax which I had not known of previously and was used to help me with this project will be below. I will attempt to learn these topics and not just copy or use them simply for this project:

### A Topic:
